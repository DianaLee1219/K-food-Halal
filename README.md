# K-food-Halal

Recently, I've met two Muslim friends in Seoul.
But finding Korean foods do not containing pork was extremely hard (Koreans love pork)

Therefore, I decided to build a food map to introduce Korean foods for Muslims.

Here's the step of this project:
1. Extract data from Muslim-friendly_restaurants.pdf made by Korean tourism organization.
2. Filter Korean foods
3. Verify real-time data through kakaomap and navermap
4. Save those locations on the maps for navigation!
