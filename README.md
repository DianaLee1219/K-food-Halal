# K-food-Halal

Recently, I met two Muslim friends in Seoul.  
However, finding Korean food that doesn't contain pork was extremely difficult â€” Koreans really love pork!

So, I decided to create a food map that introduces **Halal-friendly Korean dishes** for Muslim visitors and residents.

### Project Steps:
1. Extracted data from `Muslim-friendly_restaurants.pdf` provided by the Korea Tourism Organization.
2. Filtered for restaurants that serve Korean food.
3. Verified real-time data using KakaoMap and Naver Map.
4. Saved those locations for easy navigation and sharing!
